# Recipe by Craft
An extremely simple zero-configuration Bukkit plugin that changes the recipe system to only discover recipes once they have been crafted. 



## Why?
The recipe book is extremely convenient, but it also takes the fun out of crafting before the 1.12 days.
This plugin simply changes the recipe book to be more of a convenience feature that allows you to quickly re-craft recipes you already knew, rather than an all-knowing wiki of crafting recipes.



## Requirements
**Java**: `8`+  
**Bukkit**: `1.14`+  



## Permissions

> **recipebycraft.bypass** [default: none]  
> Restores the default Minecraft recipe book behavior.



## Building

Requires Java 8.

```bash
./gradlew jar
```

After running that command, there should be a `recipe-by-craft-1.0.jar` file inside `build/libs`.
